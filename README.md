1. Refer to the homepage conceptualization (Homepage Idea.docx)

2. Every page on the topic should have the following <might change as per need>- 
    - Sumary
    - Key characteristics
    - Habitat
    - Commonly found in
    - Diet 
    - Fun fact
    - Glossary (gallery of images)
3. Refer to the flowchart provided to organise accordingly

4. Possible ideas for individual pages - 
    - Header image of the phylum (porifer, coelenterata etc.) and then continue with the content in front of a static coloured bg.
    - Background of the whole page is an imgae, either dimly lit to accentualise the contents or otherwise
<Priority>- As you scroll, the bg images will slowly change via transform (fading to diff image/dissolving to diff image). This might eliminate the need of glossary as the viewer would be seeing the images as he goes through the contents, keeping the page interesting till the end.
